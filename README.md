> # Sync Site Discord

A simple website to sync discord users with a website

(`this is just a template`)

Configure the .env file that way:

```env
PORT=3000
CLIENTID=YouClientId
CLIENTSECRET=YouClientSecret
REDIRECTURI=http://localhost:3000/callback
MONGOURI=YouMongoUri
SESSIONSECRET=12caracterspassword
```

You need to configure it with your settings like your client id which you can get from [developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
